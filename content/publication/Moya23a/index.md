abstract: "Data accuracy, reliability, and integrity are of utmost importance in multiple scenarios, such as medical test, performance testing, etc.; data certification plays a critical role in providing trust, as it ensures that the data is guaranteed by trusted entities. However, traditional private and centralised approaches make it challenging to guarantee the veracity of the data or establish liability in cases of deliberate manipulation or human error.
This contribution introduces CertifIoT, a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based solution for certifying data gathered from data streams produced by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This approach adds transparency to the process and provides a mechanism for clarifying data provenance and recording methods. The foundation of our solution is the Phonendo Framework [1], which has been extended with additional features required for data certification. Furthermore, we propose an adaptable and extensible data model, to make certified data interoperable, and a protocol for trust endorsement, which aims at increasing the trust of certified data."
